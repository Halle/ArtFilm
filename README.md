## A CMIO Camera Extension of the creative camera type, with configuration app

ArtFilm is the sample code for the blog post [Getting To Grips With The Core Media IO Camera Extension, a 3 part series, part 3 of 3: bringing it all together by building a creative camera with realtime effects processing using vImage Pixel Buffers, which can use the Continuity Camera Webcam](https://theoffcuts.org/posts/core-media-io-camera-extensions-part-three/), from **[The Offcuts](https://www.theoffcuts.org)**.

You can also check out the [sample code for part 1](https://github.com/Halle/OffcutsCam), and the [sample code for part 2](https://github.com/Halle/TechnicalDifficulties). They are all iterations of the same CMIO Camera Extension, with an increasing featureset.
